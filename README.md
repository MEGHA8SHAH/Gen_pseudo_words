# Gen_pseudo_words


Generation of pseudo words

This Pseudoword generator is more like a simulator that lets you choose rules used to create these pseudowords.

The aim is to create pseudowords using both orthographical and phonological rules. Making this model relevant to both reading tasks as well as auditory tasks. 

The generator is only working with one language - English



Phonological rules used:

- "Voiceless stops /p/, /t/, and /k/ are asiprated in word initially and in intially stressed syllables"

- "All vowels and dipthalongs are nasalized before a nasal"

- "All vowels or dipthongs are pronounced lobger when followed by a voiced consonant"




Possible way of running the Generator:

User will have to select the language they wish to work with - default setting - English

They, will then have to select the phonological rules they wish to abide - default - ALL

They then have to choose the creation setting; using Tri-grams or Bi-grams.

Finally select the number of pseudowords it wants the generator to create.

The generator will then create a set of pseudowords in the output screen.
