# Gen_pseudo_words


Generation of pseudo words

This Pseudoword generator is more like a simulator that lets you choose rules used to create these pseudowords.

The aim is to create pesudowords using both orthographical and phonological rules. Making this model relevant to both reading tasks as well as auditory tasks. 

Users will have to first provide a list of words and then select a set of rules they would like their pseudowords to follow. 

The generator will then create a set of pseaudowords in the output screen.
