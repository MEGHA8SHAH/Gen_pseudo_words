# Gen_pseudo_words


Generation of pseudo words

This Pseudoword generator is more like a simulator that first generates bi-grams and tri-grams using a dataset of french words, and then applies phonological rules to print 2 lists of pseudowords that abid those rules.

The aim is to create pseudowords using both orthographical and phonological rules. Making this model relevant to both reading tasks testing orthographical and phological understanding. 

Project plan:
1. Import dataset
2. create bi-grams and tri-gram
3. Apply phonological rules
4. Generate pseudowords


This generator is specifically created to generate French pseudowords


How does the generator run?

step 1: Dataset consisting french words is imported.

step 2: Bi-grams and tri-grams and extracted.

step 3: Using the data all bi-grams and tri-grams are created

step 4: Generating a list of pseudowords using created bi-grams and tri-grams

step 5: Phonological rules are applied to the pseudowords

step 6: All pseudowords are printed




Phonological rule used by the project are :

([s] -> [z] / B)

This rule replaces all 's' to z in the coda position
